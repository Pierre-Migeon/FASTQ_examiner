	I'm just writing a program to do a lot of things with FASTQ files in order to learn python and to demonstrate knowledge of bioinformatic data formats. 


	A) program to test to see if there are any malformed reads in the FASTA / FASTQ file! This tests for the following:
		1) The number of bases != the quality scores
		2) No bases
		3) missing 1 of the 4 lines
		4) truncated file (same as above but file ends there...)

	The program can then remove any of the reads that are malformed, if this is possible. Truncated files just return everything before the file was trunctated. 


	B) Output summary statistics (Same as the program "FASTQC", basically, but make the graphs in python).
