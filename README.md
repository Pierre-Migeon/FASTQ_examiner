## A tool to check validity of FASTQ files, correct if necessary, and output summary graphs and statistics for these


I used this tool to quickly make some random fastq files to play with during development:
M. Frampton, R. Houlston (2012) Generation of Artificial FASTQ Files to Evaluate the Performance of Next-Generation Sequencing Pipelines.
*PLoS ONE* 7 (11), http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0049110

See the following for a description of the fastq format:
Cock PJ, Fields CJ, Goto N, Heuer ML, Rice PM. The Sanger FASTQ file format for sequences with quality scores, and the Solexa/Illumina FASTQ variants. Nucleic Acids Res. 2010;38(6):1767â€“1771. doi:10.1093/nar/gkp1137
